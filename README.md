# 2016-strategic-plan
Forked from Friendly Code's 2016 Strategic Plan

This is Allen's draft of 2016 Strategic Plan for Friendly Code, the Grand Rapids, MI chapter of Code for America. I am begining with the base strategic plan provided by Code for America for 2016.

This work's goal is two-fold. I am using this as a way to learn Github. Secondly, it is to provide a place to work on different ideas that may be incorporated into Friendly Code's 2016 Strategic Plan. This is not part of the official work of the 2016 Strategic Plan.
