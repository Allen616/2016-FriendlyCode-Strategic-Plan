# 2016 Friendly Code Strategic Plan


## Executive Summary 

_The goal of developing this plan is to help your group determine the answers to the following questions: 
Why is becoming/continuing your work as a Brigade important to your community and why is your group ready to do this? 
What will be the focus of your work in 2016? 
How will your work as a Brigade drive impact in your local community, as well as for your partners and your members?_


## 2015 Recap

_Highlight the goals of 2015 Strategic plan and briefly discuss progress / shortcomings toward the 2015 plan. How does the 2016 plan build on 2015 plan._


## Team Development

**Describe the organization and team.**
**What is your current organizational structure?** Who is on your core team? What skills and backgrounds are missing from your core team?

**How will your core team share responsibility?** How often will your core team meet? How many hours a week does everyone have to volunteer? How will you make decisions?
No need to write this down but good to discuss and set expectations.


## Partners and Members

**Describe your partners and members.**
**Who do you want to partner with in 2016?** 
- List both government and community partners._

**What does your membership look like now and how do you want it to grow in 2016?**
If you don’t have a baseline of your Brigade membership demographics, it is a good idea to run an annual survey to collect this data. [Here are the questions we ask](https://cfa.typeform.com/to/BEKp9Y).

We also have an attendance tool we can get your Brigade set up with to help you track membership activity throughout the year. Email andrewh@codeforamerica.org to get access.


## Programmatic Focus, Alignment, and Impact

**Describe the work your Brigade will do and the impact it will have in your community.**
**What will your Brigade’s activities and projects be?** 
- What resources will you need to do this work?
- What will the impact of the work be?

Most Brigades will focus their efforts on organizing hack nights and events like CodeAcross and National Day of Civic Hacking. 

Brigade projects will often be added as they develop throughout the year and require resources outside of space at hack night or events. More experienced Brigades may have projects that they want to continue developing from the previous years.

Use this prospective [projects and events](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17zHjB1FTy5Qz950MD2Dk1UhY1LoF8T81TUDVKEEkV0/edit#gid=1068986135) template to answer these questions.

## Financial Model & Fund Development
**Use these tools to identify how much your Brigade will need to fundraise in 2016.**

**What are your projected  costs for 2016?**
- Use this [[budget template]()](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ANUIfVr0M3kAFr5F6M-EnJt8dK4fMNRzBELlCfIiyUg/edit#gid=0) to document your costs.

You’ve likely identified most of your events and project costs in your [projects and events spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17zHjB1FTy5Qz950MD2Dk1UhY1LoF8T81TUDVKEEkV0/edit#gid=1068986135). Transfer those to your budget spreadsheet.

Now think through any fixed costs you’ll have throughout the year. These might include venue rental for hack night, hardware, etc.


**Are there any other fundraising strategies you’ll use that are not tied to projects or events?**
1. Crowdfunding? If so, how will you execute?
2. Individual giving campaign? If so, how will you execute?
3. Organizational sponsorship? If so, what / how?
